Description of open_FF Sources files
------------------------------------


cas_labels.csv - a list of all raw CASNumber values and how they should
   be categorized. This file is created by hand.
  
CAS_ref_and_names.csv - a list of authoritative CAS Registry numbers acquired
   from SciFinder (an online tool operated by the Chemical Abstract Service).
   Included is the SciFinder's primary name for the material.  This file is
   generated by a script.

cas_to_rename.csv - list of CAS numbers that have been deprecated and their
   appropriate replacement (based on SciFinder).  Some records in FracFocus
   use deprecated CAS numbers and we use this table to translate them. This 
   file is created by hand.

company_xlate.csv - hand-curated file that lists all names in the OperatorName
   and Supplier fields.  Each of these names has a corresponding value in a
   translation field that we use to group all raw names into a single, easily
   searchable term.

currentData.zip - the bulk download file from FracFocus.  The only change made
   to it is to rename it.

elsner_corrected_table.csv - cleaned up version of the full table from the
   Elsner-Hoelzer 2016 paper.  We use this cleaned version to link chemical 
   functions and classes to the materials in FracFocus.   

sky_truth_final.zip - cleaned and reformated version of the SkyTruth archive
   of FracFocus disclosures between 2011 and May 2013.  

state_county_ref.csv - used to compare the APINumber location codes to the
   raw reported location.  It is used to then create a best guess for the
   actual latitude/longitude and state and county names.  

TEDX_EDC_trimmed.csv - list of The Endocrine Disruption Exchange, used to 
   connect to the FracFocus data.

TSCAINV_xxxxx.csv - list of chemicals on the TSCA registry.

upload_dates.csv - list of all disclosure keys (UploadKey number) with the
   date this software first saw it and how many records were in it at
   that time.  We use the date information to generate a pubication-delay
   field.

uploadKey_ref.csv - list of disclosures with the results of the 'best guess'
   location rendering.

valid_but_empty.csv - list of CAS numbers from raw FracFocus that are valid 
   in a format sense, but do not link to real chemicals.  This file is created 
   by hand.
